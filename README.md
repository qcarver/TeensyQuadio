Recording quadraphonically  to SD with Teensy 3.2 SGTL-5000 and MAX9814 mics

This is Arduino IDE code for a teensy 3.2 driving 2 audio shields as per the infamous Spark Fun article (https://www.sparkfun.com/news/2055). Each shield is connected on each channel to an Adafruit mic. All four mics are set to 40db gain with 100uFarad electrolytics on the output to help with bias. The SD card is a SanDisk "Ultra Plus" 16GB.
